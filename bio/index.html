<p>Rich spent his life in various corporate positions and after many years and different careers; he now devotes his focus to creative passions. Having spent a lifetime studying many different ancient spiritual belief systems he was inspired to action when a new puppy, Maya, came to town. Rich lives in Connecticut with his wife, Maya, and four cats.</p><p>This book is not only for children or parents or other family members, but also for adults of all ages. The quotations cited as inspiration, open many different subjects for review and the playful manner of the interpretation and accompanying illustration can help to lift spirits and encourage creative thoughts.</p><p>A little story about this book. About 5 years ago Rich started an online business for a retail Bead Store – as a way to drive more traffic to their site, he started a blog and wanted to explore the spiritual side of this business and customers (Beads and stones have great and ancient spiritual connections)</p><p>Rich defines himself by his spiritual interests and values. He has been artistically inclined all his life, and was one of the youngest members of the Art Student's league of New York (across from Carnegie Hall). However, he used his art only for spiritual pursuits. Rich carved stone, painted, wrote poems and stories and many other creative passions – all for the give away.</p><p>The single most important guiding principle that he has and tries to live is the Golden Rule. Rich has a strong desire to make a difference and believes he can help people to feel and deal better during these terrible times of stress and anguish.</p><p><a href="https://about.me/rich.okun">Other links About Me click here</a></p><p>His path to get to this book is a 61-year journey having taken the circuitous route. There are so many things that have influenced his life in such mystical ways and after having experienced so much magic, he felt compelled to help, publishing his first book in July 2013 - The Sun, the Moon, the Stars and Maya.</p><p>– Everyday he would find a famous quote and then write a short poem expressing his interpretation of this spiritual expression – He would then add photographs to go along with the poem and then created a slideshow presentation of this for readers to enjoy. These became very popular and he was told by many people that these helped them with some of the difficult issues that they were dealing with and that it was very timely for them to read the message. – Rich and his wife had a Shih Tzu named Sammy who died in April 2011 he was 15 + years old. After seeing Rich mope around for a couple of months his wife thought it was time for another puppy and Maya (Shih Tzu puppy) chose them as her family. Rich’s daughter had asked him to perform her up-coming wedding ceremony that was to take place in September of 2011. He was able to become a Justice of the Peace to do this</p><p>– Then, in July of 2011, while walking Maya, and while thinking about the content of his upcoming wedding speech … “I am and have been like Tevye (the father in Fiddler on the roof) always talking to God/Spirit – sharing a joke, a prayer, and having a conversation especially while in nature, everyday of my life, and like so many other people, I ask spirit ‘what am I here for? What should I be doing with my life, how can I help?”</p><p>– I always wanted to hear a great big booming voice come down from above maybe James Earl Jones saying – “Just do this Rich” but I never heard any thing back. This did not deter me from continuing to ask. That day I heard a whisper – it was telling me to further develop this format (quote/poem-story/illustration/) but to use Maya as my muse and do it for children to be able to learn about spiritual matters much earlier in life and to closen the relationships between family members. Make it so parents can use it to discuss these matters with their children – help to awaken children sooner in their lives – I was taken aback as I also had a chill (on a very hot summers day) which usually indicates some connection with spirit.” says Rich. The result is this book, The Sun, the Moon, the Stars and Maya a unique format that wants to help – there will be many more books to come. Rich has also authored and illustrated several more traditional children’s’ stories using Maya as the main character – all with an eye towards making the spiritual more accessible.</p></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ms-p-h-2vw  colors-white colors-local " data-reactid="33"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ms-bd-r ms-bd-w-1" data-reactid="34"><div class="Group Group-heading ms-p-r-4" data-reactid="35"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="36"><span data-reactid="37"><!-- react-empty: 38 --><h2 class="font-title" data-reactid="39"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="40">Bio</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="41"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="42"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ms-f-s-s w-s-wrap ms-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="43"></div></div></div></section></div></div>
