What we call 'I' is just a swinging door, which moves when we inhale and when we exhale. - Shunryu Suzuki 

In the chill of the morning,
my breath takes form.
A growing mist adorning, 
like fog ahead of a storm.
With my heated exhalations,
there's movement and growth.
Cooling, crystal accumulations
whisper a frozen oath.
Commanding time to stand still,
as the cold etches and constructs, 
a perfect geometry until,
the sun's radiance destructs.
Inspiring extreme ambitions,
when the invisible is seen,
and under the right conditions 
reveals the magic of the in-between.
