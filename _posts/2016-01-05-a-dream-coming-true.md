"Dive into your heart center. Sit in the silence. Desire self-realization with all your heart, with all your mind, and all your soul. Everything will take care of itself." - Robert Adams 

_Is there anything _

_more beautiful _

_than a dream, _

_well expressed,_

_and then becoming?_

_Its a magical quest, _

_with reality succumbing _

_to an effortless molding _

_and the present _

_so perfectly unfolding? _
