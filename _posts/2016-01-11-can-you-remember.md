Can you remember 

a time before you came 

when readying 

to enter life's game. 

A teacher and healer, 

beseecher, 

and ethical wheeler-dealer; 

loving 
and caring, 

choosing an adventure 

most daring, 

that in every breath you live, 

you bless life's mosaic 

and generously give, give, give 

without asking to repay it.
