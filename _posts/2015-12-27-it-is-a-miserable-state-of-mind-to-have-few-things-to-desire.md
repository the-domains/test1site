It is a miserable state of mind to have few things to desire and many things to fear. - Francis Bacon 

Articulated in divine fashion, 

first, live in desire, 

until your passion catches fire. 

Then, spare no ration, 

merely live that inspired desire. 

And, if you falter 

worry not, 

just return and alter 

to the love you forgot. ![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/5101310823f10ba5648338bf16adc2ffc6c1ebb3.jpg)
