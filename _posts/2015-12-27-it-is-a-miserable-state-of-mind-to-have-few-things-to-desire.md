# It is a miserable state of mind to have few things to desire and many things to fear. - Francis Bacon 

# Articulated in divine fashion, 

# first, live in desire, 

# until your passion catches fire. 

# Then, spare no ration, 

# merely live that inspired desire. 

# And, if you falter 

# worry not, 

# just return and alter 

# to the love you forgot. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/68802842-609c-4f90-b1d0-2ad60589ca01.jpg)
