It is a miserable state of mind to have few things to desire and many things to fear. - Francis Bacon 

_Articulated in divine fashion, _

_first, live in desire, _

_until your passion catches fire. _

_Then, spare no ration, _

_merely live that inspired desire. _

_And, if you falter _

_worry not, _

_just return and alter _

_to the love you forgot. _
