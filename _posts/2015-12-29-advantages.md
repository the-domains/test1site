It is the greatest of all advantages to enjoy no advantage at all. - Henry David Thoreau.

Some, place great importance 
in having the upper hand,
 always needing to advance,
and having to be in command.  
But there is something to be said, 
and the greater to be gained, 
to not be so far ahead, 
rather be equal and contained. 
A great humility is invited, 
when equanimity is highlighted. 
In receptive presence 
of guided wisdom, 
a perceptive resonance 
to express your 'ism'.
